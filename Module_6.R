#Module 6 assignment
# Considering two matrices A and B
# find the sum and difference between the two

# Initialize the two matrices
A <- matrix(c(2,0,1,3), ncol = 2)
B <- matrix(c(5,2,4,-1), ncol = 2)
A
B
# Add the two matrices
A + B
# Subtract the two matrices
A - B

# Use diag() to build a matrix of size 4 with 4,1,2,3 in the diagonal
diag(c(4,1,2,3), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
